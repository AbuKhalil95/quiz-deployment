# ⚠️ DOCKER ONLY - Never run commands on host

**ALWAYS use:**

-   `docker-compose exec app php artisan [cmd]`
-   `docker-compose exec app composer [cmd]`
-   `docker-compose exec app npm [cmd]`
-   DB host: `db` (not localhost)

**Services:** app=quiz_app, db=quizzes_db, nginx=quizzes_nginx

## Migration Files

**CRITICAL: Create migration files on the host (not via docker exec) to ensure proper file permissions:**

```bash
# ✅ Preferred - Creates file with correct permissions
php artisan make:migration add_column_to_table

Migration files created via docker exec are owned by root, preventing edits. Always create migrations on the host when possible, or fix permissions immediately after creation.
```
